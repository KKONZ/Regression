## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
cars <- mtcars
cars$am <- as.character(cars$am)
 
t.test(subset(cars,cars$am=="1",select=c(mpg))[,1],
            subset(cars,cars$am=="0",select=c(mpg))[,1])

```
